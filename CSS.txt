CSS-Cascading Style Sheet
--------------------------
syntax is:
<name of the element> {
                      <style>:<value>;
		      }
body {
     colour:white;
}

There are three ways of writing css:
1.attribute/inline
2.internal
3.external
Syntax for attribute/inline:
<body style="style:value";>
Syntax for internal/external:
<name of the element> {
                      <style>:<value>;
		      }
Browser can understand colurs from 0-255

Border:
Border convention is:
<dimension> <style> <color>

Display:
is used to determine the display the nature of an element
ther re several ways to dislay an element
  1.inline
  2.block
  3.inline-block
  4.table
  5.flex
  6.none

In css cmments are given as /* */

We can capture the attributes of html in our css files to apply styles to that particular element
Capturing via id , we use # as the suffix
<element>[]-->target a specific <element>

Every element in the html has a background. the styles to background are similar to border

ids can be targeted using #tags and this is unique

To apply styles to the div element which does not have any attributes we can use class attribute
# points to id
. points to class .class name
class attribute is used to share same value across more than one element or tag

Box model:
it creates a vitrtual rectangular box around the element which can be manipulated

border-style
border-width
border-color

border: 2px(width) solid(style) #ff0000(color)

margin-left
margin-right
margin-top
margin-bottom

standardization was introduced in css box model and we have to follow it

margin: <top> <right> <bottom> <left>
padding:<top> <right> <bottom> <left>

border-radius:makes sharp curves of rectangle smooth
